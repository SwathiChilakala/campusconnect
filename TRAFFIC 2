lide 1: Title Slide
Title: "Smart Traffic Management Using AI and IoT"
Subtitle: "A Design Thinking Approach to Reducing Urban Congestion"
Include:
Your name
Date or event name
Relevant graphic, like a cityscape or a traffic flow illustration
Slide 2: Introduction
Heading: "The Problem: Urban Traffic Congestion"
Content:
Briefly introduce the issue (e.g., increasing traffic density, delays, environmental impact).
Use data or statistics to make the problem relatable (e.g., "Urban commuters spend an average of 50 hours per year stuck in traffic").
Visuals: A traffic jam photo or infographic showing global traffic issues.
Slide 3: The Design Thinking Process
Heading: "Our Approach: Design Thinking Framework"
Content:
List and briefly explain the 5 stages: Empathize → Define → Ideate → Prototype → Test.
Highlight how this approach ensures user-centered innovation.
Visuals: A simple design thinking flowchart or icons for each step.
Slide 4: Empathize
Heading: "Understanding the Problem"
Content:
Key insights from interviews, surveys, or observations (e.g., "Commuters struggle with inefficient signals, delays, and lack of real-time updates").
Challenges faced by traffic officers and environmental concerns.
Visuals:
Photos or graphics of commuters and traffic officers.
A word cloud of pain points (e.g., "delays," "pollution," "bottlenecks").
Slide 5: Define
Heading: "Defining the Problem Statement"
Content:
Problem statement: "Urban commuters and traffic management authorities face delays, inefficiencies, and environmental impacts due to poor traffic flow. An intelligent traffic system is needed to improve mobility."
Break down focus areas (e.g., real-time monitoring, adaptive signals, eco-friendly initiatives).
Visuals: A traffic flow diagram or urban map showing congestion areas.
Slide 6: Ideate
Heading: "Brainstorming Innovative Solutions"
Content:
List your ideas:
AI-based signal timing
